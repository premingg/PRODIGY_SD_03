# Simple Contact Management System

A beginner-to-intermediate level web application to manage contacts using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project is suitable for software engineering interns or anyone learning web development fundamentals.

## Features

- **Add Contact:** Enter a name, phone number, and email address to add a new contact.
- **View Contacts:** See all saved contacts in a table format.
- **Edit Contact:** Update the details of any existing contact.
- **Delete Contact:** Remove a contact from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Contacts are saved in the browser's localStorage, so your data remains even after you close or refresh the browser.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and clean GUI for easy interaction.

## How It Works

- The app uses a form to input contact details.
- The contact list is displayed below the form with options to edit or delete each entry.
- When you edit a contact, the form switches to "edit mode" and allows you to update and save changes.
- Data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, so no backend or server is required.

## How to Run

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Open the Application**

   - Locate the project folder.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. **Start Managing Contacts!**

   - Add, edit, or delete contacts using the interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the web page.
- **CSS** – Styling for a pleasant user experience.
- **JavaScript** – Functionality for adding, editing, deleting, and storing contacts.

## Notes

- The app works entirely on the client side and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.
- All contacts are stored in the browser. Clearing your browser data will remove all saved contacts.
